## Features

Upon installing and enabling the extension, users will be asked if they wish to be reminded to take breaks. If the user selects 'Yes,' alerts will be sent to them on the time increment chosen by the user (default is 60 minutes). 

An alert will provide a mental wellness tip and the option to do a body movement.  If the user clicks on "Move your body," they will be directed to an instructional video that incorporates body movements.

>Note: Please consult your physician or other health care professional before starting a fitness plan, including the instructional videos provided in this extension. If you have any concerns or questions about your health, you should always consult with a physician or other health-care professional.
